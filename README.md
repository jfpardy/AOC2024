# Advent of Code 204
This repository contains my solutions to the 2024 in odin.

## Instructions
With the odin compiler installed and in your system path, simply run "odin run ." from the project directory, or "odin run AOC2024" from the parent directory.

Once compiled and running input the relevant day number, or '*' to run all days.
